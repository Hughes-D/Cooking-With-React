# Cooking With React

I have always loved cooking and the majority of my TV viewing is the Food Network. When I decided to start learning React and taking my JavaScript skills to the next level, it was a natural pairing 🍷🍫.

+ Create, read, update, and delete recipes
+ React hooks allow instantaneous updates to recipes as you create, edit, or delete
+ All changes in a recipe's state automatically update local storage
+ Functional components shorten the length of JS files and make code easier to read and maintain throughout software development life cycle
+ Designed with intuitive UI -- read recipes on the left side of the screen and edit on the right
